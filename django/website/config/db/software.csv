Under the Gaussian process assumption, AMGeO's solution for the posterior distribution is given by Kalman filter measurement update equations.

The prior distribution is specified by the prior mean (above) and covariance.The prior covariance is less known but plays an important role in balancing weights of the prior mean and observations and spreading the observation information into data-void areas.

In AMGeO, the prior mean for electrostatic potential patterns is specified by an empirical model developed by Cousins and Shephard (JGR, 2010). Just like this prior mean model, the prior covariance model was developed using a large volume of SuperDARN data (Cousins, Matsuo and Richmond, JGR, 2013).",Collaborative data science tool for high-latitude geospace observations,98791f66-f59a-4aac-bf6c-7a9837e183cb,,,,,,,,,,,a8a650af-48d4-485b-b121-19744bc7bd48,,e32cf4ff-902f-4c5c-8755-8c8ea5ea4b21,,,,dda15b22-52b6-4462-aa53-c6a7d37a2a24,bfafc4e8-dfe0-4a79-b4cd-ebc22698469a,https://amgeo.colorado.edu/,,,0cfd9041-f1c3-44fb-a94b-01df2ed47d01

API for accessing the generalized CloudCatalog (cloudcatalog) specification for sharing data in and across clouds
CloudCatalog is a generalized indexing specification for large cloud datasets.
The push to open science means many more published datasets, and finding and accessing is important to solve. CloudCatalog is an indexing method for sharing big datasets in cloud systems. It is scientist-friendly and it is easy to generate a set of indices. It uses static index files in time-ordered CSV format that are easy to fetch, easy to access via an API, and very low cost in both money and bandwidth needed to support. Metadata is kept in a simple JSON schema. We also provide a Python client toolset for scientists to access datasets that use CloudCatalog.  
The CloudCatalog specification and tools are open source, created by the HelioCloud project, and already used for 2 Petabytes of publicly available NASA and scientist-contributed data. We hope the community continues to adopt this CloudCatalog standard (in github, linked off heliocloud.org). 
* For sharing datasets across cloud frameworks
* Decentralized: data owners control their own data and access
* RESTful & serverless (indices are flat files alongside their datasets)
* Removes need for doing slow/expensive disk ‘ls’ on large holdings
* Global registry JSON points to owner-controlled ‘buckets’
* Uses minimal JSON to list metadata, CSV files for indices
* Searchable
* Public specification here on GitHub. 
The API is designed for retrieving file catalog (index) files from a specific ID entry in a catalog within a bucket. It also includes search functionality for searching through all data index catalogs found in the bucket list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"c40fff84-4ecc-4424-a4ef-e7149737cdce,e32cf4ff-902f-4c5c-8755-8c8ea5ea4b21,fc113b25-83a1-489d-aa13-35278d852712,b45a8fd0-d7be-4e9e-b757-d2b518279470,471cb199-ed7a-4cf5-b8d6-34977c01fe8d",,,,,,https://github.com/heliocloud-data/cloudcatalog,,,3e06f23b-be87-4e4c-bdf0-40cecacf63b3

A Python package for modeling Solar EUV irradiance.
`EUVpy` is a Python module that contains the NEUVAC empirical model of solar EUV irradiance for use primarily in thermosphere-ionosphere models. 
Conceptual development was carried out by Dr. Aaron J. Ridley and analysis and contributions were made by Dr. Daniel A. Brandt and Dr. Joseph Paki. 
`EUVpy` also contains code for running, comparing, and analyzing the performance of NEUVAC in comparison to other 
empirical models such as EUVAC, HEUVAC, HFG, and FISM2. As such, the package includes access to EUVAC, HEUVAC, and HFG,
and allows the user to download the F10.7 index at will.

The system connects heliophysics data services from Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC), Helioviewer, and the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), enabling users to parse FITS headers, align event times, and automatically retrieve associated imagery and metadata. The backend, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda and Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2), handles on-demand processing and delivers all outputs through a lightweight web interface. FitsFlow produces structured, machine learning–ready outputs, including support for the Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF). Each session allows up to 170 MB of fits data and the results can be downloaded in bulk as a ZIP file containing: header metadata in JSON, pixel data in CSV and NumPy formats, colorized PNG images from Helioviewer, grayscale PNGs from JSOC, and HEK metadata in JSON format. These outputs are designed to support reproducible and interpretable ML workflows for classifying, segmenting, and forecasting solar events, laying the foundation for cyberinfrastructure that connects solar surface activity to radiation impacts in low Earth orbit (LEO). FitsFlow represents the first in a planned suite of “KISS” tools (Keep It Simple, Scientist) aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for machine learning in heliophysics. With browser-native visualization, downloadable structured examples, zero-install access, and no login required, FitsFlow broadens accessibility for researchers, educators, and citizen scientists working with solar data.","FitsFlow is a browser-based application that takes a solar FITS image and returns machine-learning ready outputs.

Abstract

In the rapidly evolving field of heliophysics research, the demand for accessible and scalable computational resources is paramount. Helio-Lite, a free and open-source framework operating within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem, leverages its infrastructure and services to provide a reproducible research environment. Derived from HelioCloud, it supports smaller research groups, provides essential prerequisites for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, and serves as a specialized tool for data sharing and computation. Utilizing AWS’s robust data storage and processing capabilities, Helio-Lite integrates customized Python kernels for heliophysics and AI/ML, facilitating efficient data analysis and advancing our understanding of solar phenomena. Key functionalities include interactive data extraction modules for Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) images, and near real-time space weather data from the Database of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI). A comprehensive examples repository further supports users in analysis and exploration. Helio-Lite addresses challenges posed by large solar datasets by parsing directly from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, improving accessibility and efficiency. Moving forward, Helio-Lite will continue to evolve through community feedback and iterative development to enhance usability and system management.

Simple Language

In simple terms:





You launch an AWS EC2 instance and paste the Helio-Lite bootstrap script.




The system automatically installs JupyterHub and configures two Conda environments: AI/ML and PyHC.




You access the JupyterHub interface from your browser and run preloaded heliophysics examples.




You can add new users, share data, and extend the platform for custom research workflows.



Helio-Lite bridges professional and citizen research, making space-weather analysis accessible, reproducible, and cloud-ready.

It is used widely in studies of the Earth's deep interior, crust, ionosphere, and magnetosphere. The model is developed and maintained by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA). The coefficients for the 14th generation of IGRF model were finalized by an IAGA task force in November 2024. The IGRF is the product of a global collaborative effort between magnetic field modelers and the institutes involved in collecting and disseminating magnetic field data collected from satellites, observatories, and surveys around the world.

This is the fourteenth generation of the model, IGRF-14, which covers the period from 1900 to 2030. It incorporates the Definitive Geomagnetic Reference Field (DGRF) for 2020.0, which supersedes the preliminary estimate for that epoch provided in IGRF-13.

For more information, see https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-geomagnetic-reference-field

The model coefficients are provided in three formats:- igrf14coeffs.txt - traditional format compatible with previous IGRF releases- IGRF14coeffs.xlsx - Excel equivalent of the above- IGRF14.shc - SHC format compatible with ESA Swarm mission software (see description here)

NB: ""Version v2"" on Zenodo includes a fix to the format of the .shc file.

VAPOR provides an interactive 3D visualization environment that can also produce animations and still frame images. VAPOR runs on most UNIX and Windows systems equipped with modern 3D graphics cards.

The VAPOR Data Collection (VDC) data model allows users progressively access the fidelity of their data, allowing for the visualization of terascale data sets on commodity hardware. VAPOR can also directly import data formats including WRF, MOM, POP, ROMS, and some GRIB and NetCDF files.

Users can perform ad-hoc analysis with VAPOR's interactive Python interpreter; which allows for the creation, modification, and visualization of new variables based on input model data.

The software is used by NASA's ICON Explorer Mission, NOAA/NSPO COSMIC-2 constellation, and is being incorporated into C/NOFS satellite analysis routines.","Orthogonal vector basis and field-line mapping for multipole magnetic fields, optimized for ionospheric plasma dynamics and electric field calculations.","3d7d5d23-29de-4b97-82f4-b84116f56f8d,b1718723-d249-419d-91b4-965f0bfacb80",https://ommbv.readthedocs.io,,,,98e08aaf-02bc-409a-a235-eea5bde71c2f,,,,"94a2e164-66ea-442b-9dbe-9d8d438eac98,45c6832d-bd3a-4aec-ad36-d6c225bce320,88e5dfce-4ee3-4959-a058-528f0c6ee932",,d7f050b7-b557-445d-a0c5-1d89918a915e,,"c40fff84-4ecc-4424-a4ef-e7149737cdce,e32cf4ff-902f-4c5c-8755-8c8ea5ea4b21","32347f93-20dd-4c31-9578-12c44022740e,4811c164-7d06-4845-95ad-c71cb87bcbc1,d041880a-b0a8-4571-afed-0c970c8a1973,0f9a1ee0-8ad6-4525-8df2-344a38d5f083,d8a0af88-9ea1-4c9c-ba43-81d2cec23c44,d67d2052-c84d-4212-a291-dc1630f3215e,fcef540a-15b3-4025-9b76-c8220cf6df46,c8de4ad3-1e94-421f-a3f8-8823f174b3f1,64173d5a-053d-4bc5-b474-354399b0b062,a06141be-91d4-4b51-b597-7dab3213178a,9f983a01-e9e6-41de-970f-8d431d79ce27,6f15480d-e2e4-4d35-8dd8-90f7fa64bb05,e0e47e8f-eb01-4a48-b02f-cb288a3ad43a,b346a12f-ea41-4891-9045-161f4360fe40,b31454f5-440c-4eba-8c84-661d295ec8aa,467425d2-4e22-4151-ad17-bc97e3c0d8bd,b5aa09a9-9577-4221-b67e-1070d2b4c569,ac7f6b94-db19-4b56-9cea-8df0981fd0a5,91831cc4-b2ac-48e6-9423-55a39a61f1e3,0b364cf5-b022-4ca9-8850-40d45d90bddb",c8d23903-28fe-407f-a643-279fe761d261,c8d23903-28fe-407f-a643-279fe761d261,"f0cba0ab-d37c-48b0-9eca-959476b762f8,3486e8ae-7da9-449e-8705-6256e42c4db0,9678da82-2203-4d29-9b84-cbab7d820b83,b32a6032-d694-40ad-84fd-7634d6d3bcf7,bbea6ab9-2135-414d-af37-d81216e13d4d",,https://github.com/CosmicStudioSoftware/OMMBV,b6c4ceb7-83af-4fa6-a9a1-5c260326d0bf,,691d7f11-cc3a-420d-9c89-223d7afa3f3a

PLUME is a numerical solver for the hot plasma dispersion relation for a plasma with an arbitrary number of drifiting bimaxwellian components. 

An overview of the code can be found in README.md, with details on the inputs and outputs in input.md and output.md files respectively.

The code is written in FORTRAN90, with instructions for installation in the install.md file.

The output data is in ASCII format, and can be plotted with gnuplot, matplotlib, or any other standard visualization methods.

An example .in input file is found in the inputs/examples/ subdirectory, along with a .sh file is illustrate the execution of the code.

The Python-based Space Physics Environment Data Analysis Software (PySPEDAS) framework supports multi-mission, multi-instrument retrieval, analysis, and visualization of heliophysics time series data. 

The recommended way of setting your local data directory is to set the `SPEDAS_DATA_DIR` environment variable. `SPEDAS_DATA_DIR` acts as a root data directory for all missions, and will also be used by IDL (if you’re running a recent copy of the bleeding edge). 
Mission specific data directories (e.g., `MMS_DATA_DIR` for MMS, `THM_DATA_DIR` for THEMIS) can also be set, and these will override `SPEDAS_DATA_DIR`
 

Pytplot is a separate project (soon to be merged into PySPEDAS), that replicates the IDL ""tplot"" functionality. Pyspedas uses a modified version of pytplot with matplotlib as the plotting library.

The igrf module offers methods based on the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) version 11, including functions to calculate the geomagnetic dipole moment, L-shell and geomagnetic field intensity, Earth's magnetic field vector components, and the smallest magnetic field strength on a field line through field-line tracing. The cxform module provides coordinate transformation capabilities, allowing users to transform Cartesian coordinates between various coordinate systems commonly used in space physics, including geocentric (GEI, J2000, GEO, MAG), magnetospheric (GSE, GSM, SM), and heliospheric (HEE, HAE, HEEQ, GSEQ, RTN) coordinate systems. The rigidity module calculates cosmic ray cutoff rigidity at various altitudes, determining the minimum particle momentum required for cosmic rays to penetrate Earth's magnetosphere at a given location. The IGRF wrapper and rigidity module were developed by David Parunakian at the Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics, while the coordinate transformation functionality is based on CXFORM, an IDL/C library originally written by Ed Santiago at LANL and maintained by Ryan Boller at NASA/GSFC.","Python package providing IGRF magnetic field calculations, cosmic ray cutoff rigidity analysis, and coordinate transformations for space physics applications.","3d7d5d23-29de-4b97-82f4-b84116f56f8d,98791f66-f59a-4aac-bf6c-7a9837e183cb,b1718723-d249-419d-91b4-965f0bfacb80",https://github.com/dpq/python-magnetosphere/blob/master/README,,,,"98e08aaf-02bc-409a-a235-eea5bde71c2f,cdf97cfa-4822-4596-b064-4a640b2efd5b",,,,"94a2e164-66ea-442b-9dbe-9d8d438eac98,45c6832d-bd3a-4aec-ad36-d6c225bce320,8d9ee163-611a-44f6-a6d1-1f15d59dd51b,343fbbbc-2220-44ae-a093-02e559ceb832",,0e565a36-a0dd-44aa-84b5-e19fbfdeefd8,,"c40fff84-4ecc-4424-a4ef-e7149737cdce,e32cf4ff-902f-4c5c-8755-8c8ea5ea4b21,fc113b25-83a1-489d-aa13-35278d852712","56765abf-02a4-4104-99d0-96ad61a95823,21991143-0622-4f5f-a416-95bbc102bd42,71671520-b0b5-4f09-b4b3-62cc4ce68cec,a0359da0-9355-4217-b653-1e485c7658ea,d67d2052-c84d-4212-a291-dc1630f3215e,454eb6e3-dc16-4d6b-8300-a7db856bd0a2,fcef540a-15b3-4025-9b76-c8220cf6df46,c8de4ad3-1e94-421f-a3f8-8823f174b3f1,caffa93f-c1bf-41b9-a24d-4eca6c41646d,b8099afe-1fe3-485d-a8fa-f5288b2a47ae,e0e47e8f-eb01-4a48-b02f-cb288a3ad43a,b2c75140-07b4-45be-ada7-0f5e0bec0033",,,,,https://github.com/dpq/python-magnetosphere,,,ea3a64c2-e239-4deb-90ad-ee76748c07a0

The implementation used here includes several added options to the original release of SAMI2, including the ability to scale the neutral atmosphere in which the ions form through direct modification of the exospheric neutral temperature for extreme solar minimum conditions, and the ability to input custom ExB drifts as a Fourier series.","Python wrapper to run, read, and plot the SAMI2 ionospheric model.","8a407b88-0930-4430-92ca-908c99a5a458,98791f66-f59a-4aac-bf6c-7a9837e183cb,b1718723-d249-419d-91b4-965f0bfacb80",http://sami2py.readthedocs.io/,,e450dc7d-846a-4c3e-ba7f-60258ac79fc8,"33620ceb-f1f1-4f74-829a-e21e625321c7,84dc38a3-649a-4cc8-b23b-a0b12580b0a1",98e08aaf-02bc-409a-a235-eea5bde71c2f,"ee56c8d9-23d6-42c9-86fa-15132600fd94,86a5ca3a-269b-4046-9094-ee635fd6fd92,3c2a1678-5c36-4201-82e7-877d7db6b1d9",,,"94a2e164-66ea-442b-9dbe-9d8d438eac98,45c6832d-bd3a-4aec-ad36-d6c225bce320,343fbbbc-2220-44ae-a093-02e559ceb832",,d7f050b7-b557-445d-a0c5-1d89918a915e,,c40fff84-4ecc-4424-a4ef-e7149737cdce,"a06141be-91d4-4b51-b597-7dab3213178a,8abdaeaa-9590-466b-8c90-dee3beeefc11,26280f9f-9c08-4b72-acd2-fe27eea943bf,4d6a1fcb-4a48-4bb8-ac16-e47941708b4f,ce4fbe62-bf60-4924-88c6-e3413fc872eb",,,,,https://github.com/sami2py/sami2py,,,f2ede119-2c91-4756-8c58-7b2ebc0ca5d8

protons. This consistes of two parts, an ncl script that manages the whole process,
and a Fortran program that is based upon code originally provided by Charlie
Jackman that calculates the ionization rates. 
THe fortran code is in source directory, and it must be compiled prior to running
the scripts. There is a Makefile and a scripts (make-proton.csh) that can be used
to compile the code. It can be executed as: 
Modifications may need to be made to the makelfile depending on your environment
and the compiler you wish to use. The objects and executables whould go into the
bin directory, and the executable name is go_proton. 
The overall script is in the scripts directory and is called spe.ncl. There are
comments in the script file, but the main execution section of the code is at the
bottom of the file: There are 4 different things that can be done: 
The raw text file are downloaded into the noaa_txt directory. These files have
5 minute data, and are converted into a 5 minute netcdf file in noass_5m and
also into a hourly file in noaa_1h. It is the hourly files that are used
to generate the ionization rates. 
The WACCM4 and WACCM6 code use different formats for the ionization data, so
the script can generate in 3 different formats: WACCM4, WACCM6,or CMIP6. The
output is put into the ions_1h directory, with subidrectories for each of
the types (w4, w6, and c6). 
The data in umbra from GOES starts on 6/13/1998 and ends on 3/9/2020, so
that is the range for which ionization rates can be calculated. There is a
scripts called spe_pad.ncl, which can be used to pad out the file to later
dates in case the are needed for the model to run, but the ionizations rates

The SolarSoftWare (SSW) system is built from Yohkoh, SOHO, SDAC and Astronomy libraries and draws upon contributions from many members of those projects. It is primarily an IDL based system, although some instrument teams integrate executables written in other languages. The SSW environment provides a consistent look and feel at widely distributed co-investigator institutions to facilitate data exchange and to stimulate coordinated analysis. Commonalities and overlap in solar data and analysis goals are exploited to permit application of fundamental utilities to the data from many different solar instruments. The use of common libraries, utilities, techniques and interfaces minimzies the learning curve for investigators who are analyzing new solar data sets, correlating results from multiple experiments or performing research away from their home institution.
Some of the primary goals of the SSW are...

Provide a large reuse SW library
The software library represents an evolutionary system tracing back to SMM, through Yohkoh and SOHO, TRACE, and eventually will incorporate SXI, HESSI, and other solar observatories. Many common ""solar physics"" , file i/o, system, IDL structure manipulation, data display, etc. tasks have already been addressed by others (many others in some cases!)
Very small sample of existing SSW capabilities...
Time series analysis, time conversions, UTPLOT (millennium safe)
Spectral fitting
Image and Image cube (movies) display
IDL data manipulation (structure, string, array, mathematics...)
File I/O (generic binary, ascii), FITS
Solar (limb fitting, grid overlay, coordinate tranformations...)
WWW related (html conversion, file conversions, FORM handling, movie making,...)
WWW Client<->SolarSoft IDL server interface permits execution of SSW/IDL utilities over the Web
Examples include SXT dynamic WWW movie maker and WWW GOES X-Ray light curve display

WWW index which allows searching for SSW routines by category and/or string pattern is available.
Provide a system which is largely hardware-system and site independent
Installation and setup utilities simplify tranportation to systems. Fundamental shared software is written in hardware-independent and site-configuration independent form. The SSW setup utilities support local configuration files to get sites up and running
Promote the use of certain standards which facilitate coordinated data analysis
Through use of suggested standards, many powerful routines are immediately available for the analysis of new data sets.
The SSWsuggested Keywords and Tags descibes pointing and time standards.
Application for overlay, alignment, scaling, rotation, etc of any SSW instruments via Dominic Zarro's Mapping software
Promote an evolutionary environment
Feedback and contributions from the many SSW institutes and users are strongly encouraged. Utilties to simplify remote SSW upgrades and accept user contribution are designed to make the system evolutionary instead of stagnant and divergent.
Provide access to supporting ancillary data bases
Access to supporting data sets from ground-based and satellite-based solar observatories are provided in consistent formats to facilitate coordinated analysis
Provide a file-format independent analysis environment
To accomodate the largest number of solar data sets, file I/O is isolated and analysis applications are designed to operate on objects which are independent of file type.
Provide integrated access to other IDL packages
When IDL libraries are identified which provide a useful extension to SSW capabilities, we will attempt to integrate them into the SSW system. For example, the Chianti Package, K. Dere et al. is now fully integrated into the SSW distribution and analysis environment for UV/EUV emission line analysis.","The SolarSoft system is a set of integrated software libraries, data bases, and system utilities which provide a common programming and data analysis environment for Solar Physics.",b1718723-d249-419d-91b4-965f0bfacb80,,,,,,,,,,,,,471cb199-ed7a-4cf5-b8d6-34977c01fe8d,,,,369b2483-6dcc-4686-a04f-da5aa856f214,bfafc4e8-dfe0-4a79-b4cd-ebc22698469a,https://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/,,,6929beaa-93fa-472d-8be2-d4c5c37e301b

The configured definition object can then iterate over binary data, parsing and yielding parsed Packet objects containing the decoded packet field values in a generator pattern. The binary data may originate from an in-memory binary object, a buffered file reader opened in binary mode, or a python socket object; in every case, a small buffer is used to read chunks of data to reduce memory footprint.

The SpacePy project seeks to promote accurate and open research standards by providing an open environment for code development. In the space physics community there has long been a significant reliance on proprietary languages that restrict free transfer of data and reproducibility of results. By providing a comprehensive, open-source library of widely-used analysis and visualization tools in a free, modern and intuitive language, we hope that this reliance will be diminished.","Please see the full release notes at https://spacepy.github.io/release_notes.html

Once a dataset is functionalized in Kamodo, several important capabilities are then available to the user, including data analysis via function composition, automatic unit conversions, and publication quality graphics all using intuitive and simplistic syntax. By applying these capabilities to heliophysics model outputs, we aim to:
-	Drastically simplify the currently complex data utilization process for model outputs,
-	Provide interactive access to functionalized model outputs for users ranging in programming skill from beginners – via code-free interfaces and video tutorials – to advanced users – via thorough documentation, Jupyter notebook examples and sample workflows,
-	Layer multiple functionalities on top of the functionalized model outputs, all with model-agnostic and uniform syntax, including but not limited to:
    - Flythrough tools,
    - Vector field tracing (including magnetic field mapping),
    - Coordinate conversions,
    - Domain-specific interactive plots of publication quality,
    - Modular driver swapping,
    - Satellite constellation mission planning tools,
    - Simulated imagery, and
    - A line of sight calculation tool,
-	Greatly reduce the programming skill currently required outside of Kamodo to perform model validation studies and model-data comparisons,
-	Enable model output utilization both on the cloud and on personal laptops in a variety of methods (e.g. through HAPI and interactive calls from the command line),
-	Streamline the CCMC user workflow by becoming interoperable with other CCMC services (e.g. CAMEL and the various scoreboards),
-	And become the next generation interface for CCMC users to interact with and analyze model outputs (e.g. through ROR and IR), 
...all while keeping the developed software open-source and freely available. The Kamodo team also supports the heliophysics community by pursuing interoperability with commonly-used python packages, collaborating with community members to add model outputs and new functionalities, and remaining involved with community events (e.g. conferences, challenges, and research support). As the library of supported model outputs types expands and new model-agnostic tools are added, Kamodo will become a staple software package in the heliophysics community to transform current workflows into a more efficient and productive process. We are building the next generation of capability with Kamodo.
