Binary wheels are now provided for Linux on 64-bit ARM, intended for Raspberry Pi.

There are no changes to dependencies, minimum versions, or installation process with this release.

## New Features
`help` now supports searching the documentation.

## Dependency requirements
Numpy 2.0 is now fully supported. 

Numpy and f2py are no longer required to build SpacePy.  Binary wheels are no longer tied to numpy or Python version.

Sphinx 4.0 is now required to build the documentation; this is not a concern for most users.

Support for Python 3.6 has been removed due to inability to test. Python 3.7 is the oldest supported Python; as a result, Astropy 2.0 is the oldest supported Astropy (if using Astropy).

## Deprecations and removals
`toolbox.timeout_check_call` is deprecated as redundant to using `subprocess.check_call` with the `timeout` argument.

The `irbempy.irbempylib` module has been removed. This was the old internal interface to the IRBEM library and was not intended for public use.

The `data_assimilation`, `radbelt`, and `spacepy_EnKF` modules have been moved to the ""sandbox"". These modules were undertested and minimally documented.

## Major bugfixes
`irbempy.find_Bmirror` now correctly returns one `Bmirr` per input pitch angle instead of ignoring all but the first.

## Other changes
Operations on `dmarray` which return a scalar value will now return a numpy array scalar rather than the base Python type. This is consistent with the behavior of `numpy.ndarray`. `dmarray` also supports assigning to its `dtype` and `shape`. Together these changes should make `dmarray` a much closer drop-in replacement for `numpy.ndarray`.

Warnings issued by SpacePy are now associated with the line of the calling code, not with the SpacePy code itself.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14057789
