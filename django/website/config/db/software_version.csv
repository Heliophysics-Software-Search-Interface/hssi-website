Binary wheels are now provided for Linux on 64-bit ARM, intended for Raspberry Pi.

There are no changes to dependencies, minimum versions, or installation process with this release.

## New Features
`help` now supports searching the documentation.

## Dependency requirements
Numpy 2.0 is now fully supported. 

Numpy and f2py are no longer required to build SpacePy.  Binary wheels are no longer tied to numpy or Python version.

Sphinx 4.0 is now required to build the documentation; this is not a concern for most users.

Support for Python 3.6 has been removed due to inability to test. Python 3.7 is the oldest supported Python; as a result, Astropy 2.0 is the oldest supported Astropy (if using Astropy).

## Deprecations and removals
`toolbox.timeout_check_call` is deprecated as redundant to using `subprocess.check_call` with the `timeout` argument.

The `irbempy.irbempylib` module has been removed. This was the old internal interface to the IRBEM library and was not intended for public use.

The `data_assimilation`, `radbelt`, and `spacepy_EnKF` modules have been moved to the ""sandbox"". These modules were undertested and minimally documented.

## Major bugfixes
`irbempy.find_Bmirror` now correctly returns one `Bmirr` per input pitch angle instead of ignoring all but the first.

## Other changes
Operations on `dmarray` which return a scalar value will now return a numpy array scalar rather than the base Python type. This is consistent with the behavior of `numpy.ndarray`. `dmarray` also supports assigning to its `dtype` and `shape`. Together these changes should make `dmarray` a much closer drop-in replacement for `numpy.ndarray`.

Warnings issued by SpacePy are now associated with the line of the calling code, not with the SpacePy code itself.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14057789

It supports complex and polymorphic packet structures, using the XTCE UML model to represent dynamic inheritance structures and conditionals based on previously parsed data fields. The core functionality of the library is the configuration of an XtcePacketDefinition object from a static XTCE XML document. The configured definition object can then iterate over binary data, parsing and yielding parsed Packet objects containing the decoded packet field values in a generator pattern. The binary data may originate from an in-memory binary object, a buffered file reader opened in binary mode, or a python socket object; in every case, a small buffer is used to read chunks of data to reduce memory footprint. The space_packet_parser library supports robust error handling, is capable of handling malformed packet structures, and can dynamically parse muxed APID packet streams.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17055485

FitsFlow is a browser-based application that takes a solar FITS image and returns machine-learning ready outputs.

Abstract

FitsFlow is a browser-based platform developed by the author to streamline the exploration and annotation of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) FITS images through a fully integrated, cloud-native environment. The system connects heliophysics data services from Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC), Helioviewer, and the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), enabling users to parse FITS headers, align event times, and automatically retrieve associated imagery and metadata. The backend, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda and Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2), handles on-demand processing and delivers all outputs through a lightweight web interface. FitsFlow produces structured, machine learning–ready outputs, including support for the Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF). Each session allows up to 170 MB of fits data and the results can be downloaded in bulk as a ZIP file containing: header metadata in JSON, pixel data in CSV and NumPy formats, colorized PNG images from Helioviewer, grayscale PNGs from JSOC, and HEK metadata in JSON format. These outputs are designed to support reproducible and interpretable ML workflows for classifying, segmenting, and forecasting solar events, laying the foundation for cyberinfrastructure that connects solar surface activity to radiation impacts in low Earth orbit (LEO). FitsFlow represents the first in a planned suite of “KISS” tools (Keep It Simple, Scientist) aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for machine learning in heliophysics. With browser-native visualization, downloadable structured examples, zero-install access, and no login required, FitsFlow broadens accessibility for researchers, educators, and citizen scientists working with solar data.

Simple Language

In simple terms:



You upload a FITS file in your browser.

FitsFlow automatically connects to NASA/NOAA data services (HEK, JSOC, Helioviewer).

The system processes everything in the cloud.

You get back a single manifest file and outputs (images, metadata, ASDF).


FitsFlow connects all the dots so researchers, educators, and the public can use solar data without special software.

Abstract

In the rapidly evolving field of heliophysics research, the demand for accessible and scalable computational resources is paramount. Helio-Lite, a free and open-source framework operating within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem, leverages its infrastructure and services to provide a reproducible research environment. Derived from HelioCloud, it supports smaller research groups, provides essential prerequisites for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, and serves as a specialized tool for data sharing and computation. Utilizing AWS’s robust data storage and processing capabilities, Helio-Lite integrates customized Python kernels for heliophysics and AI/ML, facilitating efficient data analysis and advancing our understanding of solar phenomena. Key functionalities include interactive data extraction modules for Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) images, and near real-time space weather data from the Database of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI). A comprehensive examples repository further supports users in analysis and exploration. Helio-Lite addresses challenges posed by large solar datasets by parsing directly from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, improving accessibility and efficiency. Moving forward, Helio-Lite will continue to evolve through community feedback and iterative development to enhance usability and system management.

Simple Language

In simple terms:





You launch an AWS EC2 instance and paste the Helio-Lite bootstrap script.




The system automatically installs JupyterHub and configures two Conda environments: AI/ML and PyHC.




You access the JupyterHub interface from your browser and run preloaded heliophysics examples.




You can add new users, share data, and extend the platform for custom research workflows.



Helio-Lite bridges professional and citizen research, making space-weather analysis accessible, reproducible, and cloud-ready.

5cda2e87-d51d-4257-8b85-76871462c88b,v3,2025-10-22,"The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is a standard mathematical description of the Earth's main magnetic field. It is used widely in studies of the Earth's deep interior, crust, ionosphere, and magnetosphere. The model is developed and maintained by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA). The coefficients for the 14th generation of IGRF model were finalized by an IAGA task force in November 2024. The IGRF is the product of a global collaborative effort between magnetic field modelers and the institutes involved in collecting and disseminating magnetic field data collected from satellites, observatories, and surveys around the world.

This is the fourteenth generation of the model, IGRF-14, which covers the period from 1900 to 2030. It incorporates the Definitive Geomagnetic Reference Field (DGRF) for 2020.0, which supersedes the preliminary estimate for that epoch provided in IGRF-13.

For more information, see https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-geomagnetic-reference-field

The model coefficients are provided in three formats:- igrf14coeffs.txt - traditional format compatible with previous IGRF releases- IGRF14coeffs.xlsx - Excel equivalent of the above- IGRF14.shc - SHC format compatible with ESA Swarm mission software (see description here)

NB: ""Version v2"" on Zenodo includes a fix to the format of the .shc file.
