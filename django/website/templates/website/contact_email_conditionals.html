    Since we have found {{ tool_name }} mentioned in the scientific literature, we assume that having it published again 
    on EMAC is okay. <strong>We plan to publish what information we were able to find soon unless we hear otherwise 
    from you.</strong> The info we found is likely incomplete so we highly encourage you to fill out the 
    <a href="https://emac.gsfc.nasa.gov/submissions/{{ tool_id }}">prefilled form</a> for {{ tool_name }}.
{% else %}
    Since we could not find {{ tool_name}} mentioned in any published scientific paper we do not want to 
    publish it on EMAC without your permission. <strong>Therefore, it will not appear unless we hear from you </strong>
    (either by completing the <a href="https://emac.gsfc.nasa.gov/submissions/{{ tool_id }}">prefilled form</a> 
    or by <a href="mailto:REDACTED@nasa.gov">emailing us</a>).
