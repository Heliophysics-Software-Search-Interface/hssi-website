                            The <a href="https://vast-seminars.github.io/" target="_blank">Virtual Astronomy Software Talks (VAST)</a> is a free, 
                            monthly virtual seminar series held on the 3rd Wednesday (11am US Eastern time). Each month features 
                            two 20-minute talks about astronomy-related software and topics, followed by an open discussion. The 
                            goal of these talks is to connect astronomers and physicists to developers that are creating astronomy 
                            software and databases.

                    EMAC was excited to host our first virtual workshop focused on publicly available exoplanet modeling and analysis resources!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the last few years, EMAC has built up a database of hundreds of codes and resources, with a categorization system curated by scientists at NASA Goddard. This workshop brought together our community of exoplanet model and analysis developers, in order to present and share open-source codes and expertise with the wider exoplanet community and highlight the exciting work being done with these software packages and resources.

                                                celestial mechanics calculations by constructing, manipulating, and integrating perturbative models for planetary 
                                                systems' dynamics. While direct numerical integrations with modern computers have largely replaced the need for highly 
                                                precise perturbative calculations, classical perturbation theory still plays an important role in modern planetary 
                                                dynamics by providing simplified models for a variety of complex phenomena including mean motion resonances, secular 
                                                evolution, and dynamical chaos. Classical perturbation theories in planetary dynamics can be elegantly formulated using 
                                                a Hamiltonian framework, but non-experts (and experts alike) can quickly get mired in the complexities of computing 
                                                disturbing function expansions and Laplace coefficients. The celmech code automatically computes and evaluates disturbing 
                                                function coefficients, allowing users to quickly and easily construct Hamiltonian models by adding disturbing function terms 
                                                with any desired cosine arguments. The code also interfaces closely with the popular REBOUND N-body integrator so that users 
                                                can easily compare perturbative models against direct N-body integrations. I will give an introductory tutorial and highlight 
                                                some example applications of celmech. The code can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/shadden/celmech">github.com/shadden/celmech.</a>

                                            <div class="detail">In many astrophysical environments the collisional evolution from submillimeter-sized porous dust aggregates to large bodies is an 
                                                important and complex process. We developed a Monte Carlo code that simulates collision chains in a population of dust aggregates. This population has 
                                                an initial distribution of aggregate sizes and porosities, and assume some collision velocity distribution. Then a set of successive collisions between 
                                                pairs of aggregates, choosing according to the probability given by cross section and velocity, form one collision chain. Each collision outcome between 
                                                aggregate partners depends on their mass ratio, porosity and impact velocity, which are based on our numerous previous results from granular simulations, 
                                                where adhesive and friction forces between individual grains were taken into account. We averaged up to hundreds of thousands of independent collision 
                                                chains to obtain the final, average size, mass and porosity distributions of aggregates. The number of chains traveled depends on the statistical error 
                                                asked in the input code. Alternatively, this code provides an array that interrelates quantities such as mass-porosity and size-porosity. We observe a large 
                                                generation of monomers and small clusters, and also growth of very few very large clusters. Collisions lead to significant compaction of the dust population, 
                                                as expected.

                                            <div class="detail">Many processes in protoplanetary disks and during planet formation are highly sensitive to the sizes of dust particles involved. 
                                                One example is the accretion of dust pebbles onto planets and planetary embryos. Very small dust particles are being simply deflected around the 
                                                planetary embryo and are not accreted at all. But for large dust pebbles the collisional cross section of an embryo is increased by orders of 
                                                magnitude. It is therefore crucial to know the sizes of dust particles in protoplanetary disks for an accurate estimation of the delivery of 
                                                volatiles onto protoplanets and into planetary atmospheres. DustPy is a Python package that simulates dust evolution in protoplanetary disks by 
                                                solving the Smoluchowski equation and can be used to compute the dust size distribution to estimate the accretion flux of dust onto planetary 
                                                embryos. I will give a brief introduction to the usage of DustPy and will highlight some research projects that have been achieved using the software.

                                                present the science and implementation behind the two major orbit analysis packages I've worked on, <a href="https://radvel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">RadVel</a> and 
                                                <a href="https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">orbitize!</a>. I'll also talk about the decisions involved in open-sourcing our projects and the lessons I've learned 
                                                since then. Finally, I'll advertise <a href="https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/">Code/Astro</a>, a workshop on open-source software for astronomers, and discuss how my 
                                                experiences as a software development intern at Google have influenced my astronomy code.

                                                phase spectrum of bivariate time series with nonuniform observing cadence. For univariate time series, users can apply the Welch's 
                                                power spectrum estimator or compute a nonuniform fast Fourier transform-based periodogram. Options include tapering in the time domain 
                                                and computing bootstrap false alarm levels. Users may choose standard 50%-overlapping Welch's segments or apply a custom-made segmentation 
                                                scheme constructed around seasonal gaps in the time series. NWelch was designed for Doppler planet searches but may be applied to any type

                                                instrument response, estimate scientific yields, perform trade analyses, and study efficient observation strategies. In this talk 
                                                I will describe a new suite of planetary system models that contain all of the basic physics necessary to enable study with all 
                                                major exoplanet detection methods. This software tool, exoVista, quickly generates thousands of models of quasi-self-consistent 
                                                planetary systems around known nearby stars at scattered light wavelengths and efficiently records the position, velocity, 
                                                spectrum, and physical parameters of all bodies as functions of time. The modeled planetary systems can be used to simulate surveys 
                                                using the direct imaging, transit, astrometric, and radial velocity techniques, as well as the overlap of these different methods.

                                                Telescope (HST). These templates give users a good starting point for their analyses, but Eureka! is not intended to be used as a black-box 
                                                tool, and users should expect to fine-tune some settings for each observation in order to achieve optimal results. At each stage, the pipeline 
                                                creates intermediate figures and outputs that allow users to compare Eureka!'s performance using different parameter settings or to compare 
                                                Eureka! with an independent pipeline. Here we present a stage-by-stage breakdown of the Eureka! pipeline and its basic functionalities as well 
                                                as the resources available to the community so they may further familiarize themselves with Eureka! and its uses.

                                                transit and at secondary eclipse. In order to simplify the process of knowledge extraction and initial comparison to models, I have been 
                                                working to create a variety of atmosphere models and spectra for each of the exoplanets that are set to be observed in cycle 1. For each 
                                                planet, I use the Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Spectroscopy Observations (PICASO) code, an open-source 1D python model, to create

                                                These simulations will serve an important baseline, both for the initial comparison to JWST spectra, and as a starting point to more detailed

                                                accuracy and robustness. A number of models are thus turning to multi-dimensional simulations to that aim. Pytmosph3R is an open-source Python 
                                                package that can generate synthetic emission and transmission spectra using 3D atmospheric simulations (such as GCMs). It is designed as a post-process

                                                has been used in a number of studies (Caldas et al. 2019, Falco et al. 2022, Pluriel et al. 2022, McDonald et al. 2022) and in hands-on sessions or

                                                observations with HST, Spitzer, and various ground-based telescopes both with low to moderate-resolution spectroscopy and high-resolution 
                                                cross-correlation approaches. Additionally, with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), in conjunction with the launch of the James Webb 
                                                Space Telescope (JWST), we can expect hundreds of planet detections followed by detailed spectroscopic characterization of their atmospheres. The 
                                                compositional and temperature diversity of these worlds provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into planetary atmospheric chemical processes 
                                                and formation pathways. One of NASA's primary goals is to observationally characterize exoplanet atmospheres, understand the chemical and physical 
                                                processes of exoplanets and improve the understanding of the origins of exoplanetary systems. In the coming decade, starting with JWST, we will work 
                                                towards achieving these goals by interpreting a diverse set of exoplanet atmosphere observations, ranging from hot gas giants to small temperate 
                                                rocky worlds. Our understanding and interpretation of this full gamut of data will hinge on our ability to link observations to theoretical models, 
                                                and then our ability to link those models to fundamental molecular and atomic opacities. Opacities serve as a fundamental input to all models used 
                                                for exoplanet atmospheric characterization. The limitation of pressure-broadening data in the current opacities for HST/JWST resolutions, as well 
                                                as the critical need for accurate spectral line position for cross-correlation technique could lead to serious uncertainties and biases on the 
                                                observables including uncertainty in the C/O ratio, thermal structure, and atmospheric composition. Hence, a thorough assessment of opacities is 
                                                instrumental to achieving a full understanding of exo-atmospheres across several measurement techniques. In this talk, we will give an overview of 
                                                the current status of a set of key atmospheric absorbers relevant to late-type stellar, brown dwarf, and planetary atmospheres, to give the community 
                                                intuition for selecting line lists for different measurement techniques. For example, H2O has four different "current" opacities which have different 
                                                line positions, intensities, and transitions. We will discuss their impact on low-to-medium resolution HST/JWST spectroscopy and cross-correlation 
                                                functions to illustrate the importance of opacity choices. We will focus on molecules that have been the subject of recent observation campaigns. 
                                                This includes the noticeable disagreements between different TiO and VO line lists and their impact on synthetic emission/transmission spectra, as 
                                                well as CH4 and FeH. In sum, an overview of the current challenges in opacity data and their practical influence on radiative transfer modeling will 
                                                be outlined, and motivated. Lastly, our team's endeavors at NASA Ames research center to leverage these disagreements and concerns on opacity data 
                                                and the lack of sufficient pre-computed and evaluated datasets will be addressed. Our comprehensive opacity database, MAESTRO, will be introduced 
                                                as a means to alleviate community access to opacities.

                                            <div class="detail">We present the second generation of ROCKE-3D (Resolving Orbital and Climate Keys of Earth and Extraterrestrial Environments with Dynamics), 
                                                a generalized 3-dimensional General Circulation Model (GCM) for use in Solar System and exoplanetary simulations of rocky planet climates. ROCKE-3D version 
                                                2.0 is a descendant of ModelE2.1, the flagship GCM of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) used in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel 
                                                for Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. ROCKE-3D is a continuous effort to expand the capabilities of GISS ModelE to handle a broader range of atmospheric 
                                                conditions, including different atmospheric planet sizes, gravities, pressures, rotation rates, more diverse chemistries and atmospheric compositions, 
                                                diverse ocean and land distributions and topographies, and potential basic biosphere functions. In this release we present updated physics, and many more 
                                                supported configurations which can serve as starting points to simulate the atmospheres of rocky terrestrial planets of interest. Two different radiation 
                                                schemes are supported, the GISS radiation, valid only for atmospheres similar to that of modern Earth, and SOCRATES, which is more generalized but more 
                                                computationally expensive. Three different atmospheric composition options are supported (preindustrial Earth, the atmosphere used in ROCKE-3D 1.0, and 
                                                an anoxic atmosphere with no aerosols), three ocean configurations (prescribed, Q-flux, and dynamic), and two resolutions: the medium resolution (4x5 
                                                degrees in latitude and longitude, previously used in ROCKE-3D 1.0), and the fine resolution, which has double the resolution in the atmosphere and 4 times 
                                                the horizontal and 3 times the vertical resolution in the ocean. Finally, for the land surface hydrology, we have introduced generalized physics for 
                                                arbitrary topography in the pooling and evaporation of water and river transport of water between grid cells, and for the vertical stratification of 
                                                temperature in dynamic lakes. We quantify how the different component choices affect model results, and discuss strengths and limitations of using each 
                                                component, together with how one can select which component to use. ROCKE-3D is publicly available and tutorial sessions are available for the community, 
                                                greatly facilitating its use by any interested group.

                                                better interpret the new spectra. Thanks to future space missions like JWST, ARIEL and Twinkle, indeed, the observed spectra will be precise enough to 
                                                reveal features which cannot be modeled with a one-dimensional plane parallel atmosphere, especially in the case of Ultra Hot Jupiters. Bayesian frameworks 
                                                are computationally intensive and prevent us from using complete three-dimensional self-consistent models to retrieve an exoplanetary atmosphere, and, 
                                                they constrain us to use simplified models to converge to a set of atmospheric parameters. We propose the TauREx2D retrieval code, which uses two-dimensional 
                                                atmospheric models as a good compromise between computational power and model precision to better infer exoplanetary atmospheres. Finally, we apply such a 
                                                model on synthetic spectrum computed from a GCM simulation of WASP-121b and show the parameters retrieved bythe new TauREx 2D retrieval code.

                                                how the processes thought to shape Earth's atmospheric composition might operate on exo-Earths (here defined as terrestrial planets with surface 
                                                liquid water) whose size and bulk composition may differ. As a first step, the ExoCcycleGeo code allows investigation of how variations in planet 
                                                size and the chemical (mineral) composition of its upper mantle and surface affects key processes involved in the carbonate-silicate cycle, which 
                                                is thought to have regulated the composition of Earth's atmosphere and its surface temperature over its geological history. ExoCcycleGeo couples a 
                                                simple model of thermal evolution with widely used geochemical codes, called as subroutines, that compute solid-melt equilibria for silicate rocks 
                                                (MELTS) and equilibria and kinetics of water-rock interactions (PHREEQC). Outputs include, as a function of geologic time: reservoirs and fluxes of 
                                                carbon; mantle temperature and convective velocity; lithospheric heat flux and thickness; surface pressure, temperature, and mixing ratios of CO2, 
                                                N2, H2O, CH4, and O2; rainwater, river, and ocean pH; ocean redox; and detailed river and ocean compositions such as abundances of key soluble 
                                                species (Na, Mg, Ca, Cl, sulfate, Fe, Si, oxidized and reduced carbon species, etc.). The code's calculations of outgassing and weathering fluxes 
                                                are validated against modern and Archean Earth conditions. The source in C language is available at <a href="https://github.com/MarcNeveu/ExoCcycleGeo">https://github.com/MarcNeveu/ExoCcycleGeo</a>.

                                                silicates. Many previous studies suggest that the magma ocean depth can reach tens of to hundreds of kilometers by assuming adiabatic or vertically 
                                                constant temperature profiles. The effect of ocean dynamics has not been considered yet. In our study, we try to simulate the magma ocean depth 
                                                using a 2D(x-z) Matlab model written by ourselves. Our simulation results show that the magma ocean depth considering ocean dynamics is much shallower 
                                                than that not considering within-pool ocean overturning circulation. Consistent to the scaling theory, the magma ocean depth is strongly determined 
                                                by the magnitude of vertical diffusivity. The effect of wind stress is evident only when the wind stress is hundreds to thousands of times that on 
                                                Earth, which could make the magma ocean depth even shallower.

                                            <div class="detail">The extreme ultraviolet photons incident on an exoplanet become deposited in its upper atmosphere. The most energetic 
                                                of these photons eject one or more electrons from the heavy particles in the gas. The nascent photoelectrons carry away as kinetic energy 
                                                the excess of the photon energy over the ionization threshold, and can induce transformations in the gas that are often inhibited for 
                                                thermal electrons. The transformations include excitation and ionization of atoms and molecules, which affect the detectability of these 
                                                gases and constrain the fraction of incident stellar radiation that transforms into heat and may therefore affect the long-term stability 
                                                of the atmosphere. We have built a Monte Carlo model that solves the slowing down of photoelectrons in a gas with arbitrary amounts of H, 
                                                He and O atoms, and thermal electrons. The novel multi-score scheme differs from other Monte Carlo approaches in that it efficiently handles 
                                                rare collisional channels, as in the case of low-abundance excited atoms that undergo superelastic and inelastic collisions. The Monte Carlo 
                                                model, which is freely available, has been extensively demonstrated in a recent paper (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115373">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115373</a>). The 
                                                presentation will focus on the working principles of the Monte Carlo model and its possibilities to investigate the atmospheres of exoplanets.

                                            <div class="detail">The photoevaporation model is one of the leading explanations for the evolution of small, close-in planets and the origin of the 
                                                radius-valley. However, without planet mass measurements, it is challenging to test the photoevaporation scenario. EvapMass predicts the minimum 
                                                masses of planets in multi-planet systems using the photoevaporation-driven evolution model. The planetary system requires both a planet above 
                                                and below the radius gap to be useful for this test. EvapMass can be used to identify transiting systems that warrant radial-velocity follow-up 
                                                to further test the photoevaporation model. In this talk, I will walk you through the physics of the problem and how you can use EvapMass to test 
                                                any multitransiting system for photoevaporation.

                                                equation (Fokker-Planck equation) or an advection-diffusion equation using various curvilinear coordinates of physical convenience. Solving 
                                                these equations is usually not a trivial task. In this presentation, we introduce a numerical solver that can solve the general form of an 
                                                advection-diffusion equation in arbitrarily provided coordinate systems in multiple dimensions, with user-specified boundary geometry, boundary 
                                                conditions, and equation terms. The solver is based upon the mathematical theory of stochastic differential equations, whose computational accuracy 
                                                and efficiency are greatly enhanced by specially designed adaptive algorithms and variance reduction technique. The solver also applies to problems 
                                                with jumping particle transport. Versatility and robustness of the solver is exhibited in example problems. The solver is an open-source software,

                                                time-series later analysed to characterise exoplanetary systems. To process these images, scientists generally make use of pipelines: a 
                                                set of processing units sequentially executed on each image before being combined into exploitable products. While requiring a large effort, 
                                                pipelines developed by scientists are usually instrument-specific, poorly maintainable, and yield products suffering from a low-level of 
                                                reproducibility and portability. In this talk I present prose, a Python package allowing scientists to build robust, modular and transparent 
                                                pipelines, focusing on what matters. By providing a set of pre-implemented blocks, one can easily assemble and test processing sequences, 
                                                and only develop the blocks they need. This approach not only yields reproducible tools, it allows for rapid iteration towards pipelines with 
                                                optimal scientific products. I will present the main concepts behind prose, and its use in various projects, among which are the TESS

                                                its host star and the Earth. If we record the host star's emitted light, known as the flux, and observe how it changes as a function of time, 
                                                we should observe a small dip in the brightness when a transit event occurs. A graph of host star flux vs. time is known as a lightcurve, and 
                                                it holds the key to determining how large the planet is, and how long it will be until it transits again.

                                            <div class="detail">Stellar photometric variability and instrumental effects, like cosmic ray hits, data discontinuities, data leaks, 
                                                instrument aging etc. cause difficulties in the characterization of exoplanets and have an impact on the accuracy and precision of 
                                                the modelling and detectability of transits, occultations and phase curves. This work aims to make an attempt to improve the transit, 
                                                occultation and phase-curve modelling in the presence of strong stellar variability and instrumental noise. We invoke the 
                                                wavelet-formulation to reach this goal. We explore the capabilities of the software package Transit and Light Curve Modeller (TLCM). 
                                                It models the RV-curve + light curve: transit, occultation, beaming, ellipsoidal and reflection effects in the light curves (including 
                                                the gravity darkening effect, too). The red-noise, the stellar variability and instrumental effects are modelled via wavelets. The 
                                                wavelet-fit is constrained by prescribing that the final white noise level must be equal to the average of the uncertainties of the 
                                                photometric data points. This helps to avoid the overfit and regularizes the noise model. The approach was tested by injecting synthetic 
                                                light curves into Kepler's short cadence data and then modelling them. We give limits in terms of signal-to-noise ratio for every studied 
                                                system parameter which is needed to accurate parameter retrieval. The wavelet-approach is able to manage and to remove the impacts of 
                                                data discontinuities, cosmic ray events, long-term stellar variability and instrument ageing, short term stellar variability and 
                                                pulsation and flares among others. Precise light curve models combined with the wavelet-method and with well prescribed constraints on 
                                                the white noise are able to retrieve the planetary system parameters, even when strong stellar variability and instrumental noise 
                                                including data discontinuities are present.

                                            <div class="detail">Future direct imaging missions aiming to detect and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars may encounter a "confusion" 
                                                problem when imaging a multi-planet system. Previous work has shown that planets in multi-planet systems can be âconfusedâ in direct images taken over 
                                                multiple epochs due to lack of prior knowledge about the planet's orbital parameters or planetary characteristics. Here, we consider a system to be 
                                                confused when it has multiple possible orbit combinations for the planets that describe the data equally well and it's not obvious which detection 
                                                belongs to which planet. We address the confusion problem with a publicly available "deconfusion" algorithm, which leverages astrometric information to 
                                                fit orbits to planets and help differentiate between multiple planets in an image. The deconfusion algorithm accepts unlabeled planet detections with 
                                                astrometric information and generates orbit matches. The matches are ranked based on their consistency with the presented data and the number of matched 
                                                observations. We also introduce the inclusion of photometric considerations in the deconfusion algorithm to help differentiate between possible orbits. 
                                                We are investigating the utility of orbital phase information for each planet in simulated planetary systems to reduce the rate of confusion in a 
                                                multi-planet system. We aim to ultimately provide updated estimated confusion rates for planetary systems and a useful tool for direct imaging surveys.

                                                long been understood that the light curve of a transiting planet constrains the density of its host star. That fact is routinely used to improve measurements 
                                                of the stellar surface gravity and has been argued to be an independent check on the stellar mass. I'll discuss how the stellar density from a transit light 
                                                curve can also provide meaningful constraints on the radius and effective temperature of the star. This additional constraint is especially significant when 
                                                we account for systematic errors in stellar modeling, but only when the planet, star, and systematic floors are simultaneously modeled.

                                                data that can be used to characterize a gravitationally bound system of stars and planets including phenomena such as transits, 
                                                flares, and spots. We highlight the capabilities of allesfitter and benchmark its performance by illustrating its use on a few 
                                                confirmed exoplanetary systems. Given some time-series data, allesfitter takes fair samples from the posterior and enables
